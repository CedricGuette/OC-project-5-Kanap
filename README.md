# OC-Project-5-Kanap

### Description from original repo : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P5-Dev-Web-Kanap  ###
This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

###What I've done?###

All javascript from front folder was added by my own
I've decided to use object-oriented programming to train a bit

Here is a list of skills required to make it proper :
- Create a test plan for an application
- Handle JavaScript events
- Interact with a web service with JavaScript
- Validate data from external sources

Used technology:
JavaScript (object-oriented)
